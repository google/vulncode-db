## Overview
The vulnerable code database (Vulncode-DB) is a database for vulnerabilities and their corresponding 
source code if available. The database extends the NVD / CVE data sets with user-supplied 
information regarding patch links, vulnerable code offsets and descriptions.
Particularly, the database intends to make real-world examples of vulnerable code universally accessible and useful.

The main instance is hosted on [vulncode-db.com](https://www.vulncode-db.com) and more context is provided at [vulncode-db.com/about](https://www.vulncode-db.com/about).

**Please note:** 

This application is currently in an experimental alpha version mostly for demonstration purposes.
The application might be unreliable, contains many bugs and is not feature complete. Please set your expectations accordingly.

## Setup
The setup is simplified with Docker and docker-compose in particular. Having these prerequisites installed you can setup
 the project using the following instructions:
 
```
# Clone the repository and its (third-party) submodules.
git clone --recursive https://github.com/google/vulncode-db.git
cd vulncode-db
# Setup configuration files, the Docker images and containers.
./setup.sh
# Initialize the application and run an empty version of it.
./docker/docker-admin.sh start
```

Additionally, if you intend to add some data consider running:
```
# Fetch and insert CWE identifiers and some recent NVD entries.
./docker/docker-admin.sh init
# Search for entries with patch links and add additional application entries for them.
./docker/docker-admin.sh crawl_patches
# Run the application.
./docker/docker-admin.sh start
```
The main application should then be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

Please also see the documentation provided in `docker/README.md` for more details.
